## Final Note

This rebuild is not an official redesign of Kotae.io. It was created independently as a technical and design showcase. The website was built with limited data available, which meant certain content and features were created based on logical assumptions and creative interpretation. The dashboard and some of its features, including analytics, charts, and user authentication, are purely demonstrative and were built to highlight frontend engineering capabilities.

## About Me

I'm a front-end web developer with a passion for building sleek, interactive UIs. I enjoy crafting creative digital experiences, exploring Japanese culture, and constantly pushing my skills forward. Beyond just writing code, I’m deeply interested in how design, interactivity, and performance intersect to create user experiences that are both elegant and effective. Currently, I’m focused on refining my technical capabilities while laying the groundwork for my next professional chapter—ideally one that bridges my love for tech and Japan.

## Why I Chose to Rebuild Kotae

I chose to rebuild Kotae because I genuinely admire what the product represents. In a landscape where large corporations dominate the AI space, small businesses often get left behind. Kotae, as an AI chatbot, has the potential to help these businesses amplify their reach and efficiency.

However, I felt that the existing website didn’t fully reflect the strength and potential of the product. The visual design came across as somewhat playful and didn’t align with the serious value proposition Kotae offers. My intention was to craft a digital presence that immediately tells users, "Kotae means business."

With that vision in mind, I redesigned the landing page and built a professional dashboard interface, both of which aim to present Kotae as the powerful, business-grade tool that it is. This rebuild is a personal initiative to reflect my frontend design thinking, UI/UX sensitivity, and overall development proficiency.
